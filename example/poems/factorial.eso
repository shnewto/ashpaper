    like a folding
   up, a
  branch-work growth
              of
      AshPaper trees come together
as we demand
      perfect edges, impossible creases
  a Scream of roots
    toe-curled
    inward
gro(w/a)n
    past lines of pebbles, into wellstones
                              cracked. broken.
perfect edges impossibly creased
what's left of that?
